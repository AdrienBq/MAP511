you want to get out of here , don 't you? 
wash your hands . 
i 've always loved you . 
they speak french in quebec . 
tom has a beautiful smile . 
a rack of lamb makes a great meal . 
do you know how to sail? 
i remember it vividly . 
do you think i 'm fat? 
three men broke out of prison yesterday . 
do you have a bigger one? 
the regulation was abolished , but then it was reenacted . 
you should exercise . 
you 've got small eyes . 
they did not know it was impossible , so they did it . 
what did they look like? 
tom stormed out of the meeting . 
i haven 't thought much about it . 
i really can 't talk about this . 
i am frying fish . 
this room is very warm . 
i don 't like math , much less physics . 
tom is seldom ever on time .
